Inside the Backend, I only made two APIs. The first involves storing data, while the second involves retrieving data from storage. I employ the MVC Structure in the backend. However, because it's not a particularly large project, I'm not implementing Mongoose. Implement Moongose without a doubt if the project is large; I have used it previously. I'm not making any.env files. However,Â I am aware that this is inappropriate for a major project. Everything is kept in visible storage by me. since it will assist you, sir, if you need to check.
